                Our mechanical division works hard to design all of the structural and aerodynamic components of our vehicles. 
                Through use of softwares such as SolidWorks and Ansys, they design critical components of our vehicle such as the chassis, aeroshell, and suspension components.

                Our electrical division works on anything that has power on the car which consists of the battery management systems, low voltage systems, and power electronics teams. 
                They work on projects from displaying important information to the driver using screens to building custom battery packs for the car. 
                They also build radio and cellular communication so that the ground team can review all the data from the car while it drives.
